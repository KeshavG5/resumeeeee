<h1>About Me</h1>
<p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 500; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Hello, I'm Keshav Gupta, A passionate college student with a deep interest in this feild.<br />
I chose commerce stream with informatics practices as my subject in highschool.
The reason why I chose to go this stream wasn't because I wanted to be an accountant but to achieve financial literacy.
I read personal finance books and this stream helped me to understand the basics of accounting which gave me a clear understanding while reading. And picking informatics practices as a subject instead of maths in my highschool helped me to pursue my computer degree.</p> 

<p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 500; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I showed a sudden interest in this feild and I started my journey by learning web development through the Udemy platform.
    and Pursuing a computer applications degree.Here is a basic HTML project which I created as a beginner <a href="../4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/index.html">my portfolio project</a>. I will be adding more to this 
project as I keep progressing further.</p>
